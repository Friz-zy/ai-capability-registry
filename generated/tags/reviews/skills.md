# reviews

## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### second-opinion
Runs external LLM code reviews (OpenAI Codex or Google Gemini CLI) on uncommitted changes, branch diffs, or specific commits. Use when the user asks for a second opinion, external review, codex review, gemini review, or mentions /second-opinion.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/second-opinion/skills/second-opinion/SKILL.md`

### secure-workflow-guide
Guides through Trail of Bits' 5-step secure development workflow. Runs Slither scans, checks special features (upgradeability/ERC conformance/token integration), generates visual security diagrams, helps document security properties for fuzzing/verification, and reviews manual security areas.

### security-best-practices
Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements. Trigger only when the user explicitly requests security best practices guidance, a security review/report, or secure-by-default coding help. Trigger only for supported languages (python, javascript/typescript, go). Do not trigger for general code review, debugging, or non-security tasks.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/security-best-practices/SKILL.md`

### skill-improver
Iteratively reviews and fixes Claude Code skill quality issues until they meet standards. Runs automated fix-review cycles using the skill-reviewer agent. Use to fix skill quality issues, improve skill descriptions, run automated skill review loops, or iteratively refine a skill. Triggers on 'fix my skill', 'improve skill quality', 'skill improvement loop'. NOT for one-time reviews—use /skill-reviewer directly.
