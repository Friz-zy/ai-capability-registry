## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### claude-api
Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements). TRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project. SKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.

### debug
Structured debugging session — reproduce, isolate, diagnose, and fix. Trigger with an error message or stack trace, "this works in staging but not prod", "something broke after the deploy", or when behavior diverges from expected and the cause isn't obvious.

### debug-zoom
Debug a broken Zoom integration by isolating the failure point and routing into the right Zoom references. Use when auth, API, webhook, SDK, or MCP behavior is failing and you need a ranked hypothesis list plus verification steps.

### debug-zoom-integration
Debug broken Zoom implementations quickly. Use when auth, webhooks, SDK joins, MCP transport, or real-time media workflows are failing and you need to isolate the layer before proposing a fix.

### dwarf-expert
Provides expertise for analyzing DWARF debug files and understanding the DWARF debug format/standard (v3-v5). Triggers when understanding DWARF information, interacting with DWARF files, answering DWARF-related questions, or working with code that parses DWARF data.

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

### gh-fix-ci
Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions; use `gh` to inspect checks and logs, summarize failure context, draft a fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval. Treat external providers (for example Buildkite) as out of scope and report only the details URL.

### openai-gh-fix-ci
Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions;
