## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### agentic-actions-auditor
Audits GitHub Actions workflows for security vulnerabilities in AI agent integrations including Claude Code Action, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub AI Inference. Detects attack vectors where attacker-controlled input reaches AI agents running in CI/CD pipelines, including env var intermediary patterns, direct expression injection, dangerous sandbox configurations, and wildcard user allowlists. Use when reviewing workflow files that invoke AI coding agents, auditing CI/CD pipeline security for prompt injection risks, or evaluating agentic action configurations.

### algorand-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Algorand smart contracts for 11 common vulnerabilities including rekeying attacks, unchecked transaction fees, missing field validations, and access control issues. Use when auditing Algorand projects (TEAL/PyTeal).

### c-review
Performs comprehensive C/C++ security review for memory corruption, integer overflows, race conditions, and platform-specific vulnerabilities. Use when auditing native C/C++ applications, reviewing daemons or services for memory safety, or hunting integer overflow / use-after-free / race conditions in userspace code.

### constant-time-analysis
Detects timing side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic code. Use when implementing or reviewing crypto code, encountering division on secrets, secret-dependent branches, or constant-time programming questions in C, C++, Go, Rust, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or Ruby.

### cosmos-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Cosmos SDK blockchain modules and CosmWasm contracts for consensus-critical vulnerabilities — chain halts, fund loss, state divergence. 25 core + 16 IBC + 10 EVM + 3 CosmWasm patterns. Use when auditing custom x/ modules, reviewing IBC integrations, or assessing pre-launch chain security. Updated for SDK v0.53.x.

### dimensional-analysis
Annotates codebases with dimensional analysis comments documenting units, dimensions, and decimal scaling. Use when someone asks to annotate units in a codebase, perform a dimensional analysis, or find vulnerabilities in a DeFi protocol, offchain code, or other blockchain-related codebase with arithmetic. Prevents dimensional mismatches and catches formula bugs early.

### scv-scan
Audits Solidity codebases for smart contract vulnerabilities using a four-phase workflow (cheatsheet loading, codebase sweep, deep validation, reporting) covering 36 vulnerability classes. Use when auditing Solidity contracts for security issues, performing smart contract vulnerability scans, or reviewing Solidity code for common exploit patterns.
