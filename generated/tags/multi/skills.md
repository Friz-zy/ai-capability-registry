### customer-research
Multi-source research on a customer question or topic with source attribution. Use when a customer asks something you need to look up, investigating whether a bug has been reported before, checking what was previously told to a specific account, or gathering background before drafting a response.

### email-sequence
Design and draft multi-email sequences with full copy, timing, branching logic, exit conditions, and performance benchmarks. Use when building onboarding, lead nurture, re-engagement, win-back, or product launch flows, when you need a complete drip campaign with A/B test suggestions, or when mapping a sequence end-to-end with a flow diagram.

### figma-generate-design
Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values.

### rivet-sdk
Reference skill for Zoom Rivet SDK. Use after routing to a Rivet-based server workflow when implementing auth handling, webhook consumers, API wrappers, multi-module composition, or Lambda receiver patterns.

### scvi-tools
Deep learning for single-cell analysis using scvi-tools. This skill should be used when users need (1) data integration and batch correction with scVI/scANVI, (2) ATAC-seq analysis with PeakVI, (3) CITE-seq multi-modal analysis with totalVI, (4) multiome RNA+ATAC analysis with MultiVI, (5) spatial transcriptomics deconvolution with DestVI, (6) label transfer and reference mapping with scANVI/scArches, (7) RNA velocity with veloVI, or (8) any deep learning-based single-cell method. Triggers include mentions of scVI, scANVI, totalVI, PeakVI, MultiVI, DestVI, veloVI, sysVI, scArches, variational autoencoder, VAE, batch correction, data integration, multi-modal, CITE-seq, multiome, reference mapping, latent space.

### search-strategy
Query decomposition and multi-source search orchestration. Breaks natural language questions into targeted searches per source, translates queries into source-specific syntax, ranks results by relevance, and handles ambiguity and fallback strategies.

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.

### web-artifacts-builder
Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component claude.ai HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts.

File: `external/anthropic-skills/skills/web-artifacts-builder/SKILL.md`

### write-query
Write optimized SQL for your dialect with best practices. Use when translating a natural-language data need into SQL, building a multi-CTE query with joins and aggregations, optimizing a query against a large partitioned table, or getting dialect-specific syntax for Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc.
