# layout

## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### design-handoff
Generate developer handoff specs from a design. Use when a design is ready for engineering and needs a spec sheet covering layout, design tokens, component props, interaction states, responsive breakpoints, edge cases, and animation details.

### example-command
An example user-invoked skill that demonstrates frontmatter options and the skills/<name>/SKILL.md layout

### figma-generate-design
Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values.

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

### openai-pdf
Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills-curated/plugins/openai-pdf/skills/openai-pdf/SKILL.md`

### pdf
Use when tasks involve reading, creating, or reviewing PDF files where rendering and layout matter; prefer visual checks by rendering pages (Poppler) and use Python tools such as `reportlab`, `pdfplumber`, and `pypdf` for generation and extraction.

### plugin-structure
This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a plugin", "scaffold a plugin", "understand plugin structure", "organize plugin components", "set up plugin.json", "use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}", "add commands/agents/skills/hooks", "configure auto-discovery", or needs guidance on plugin directory layout, manifest configuration, component organization, file naming conventions, or Claude Code plugin architecture best practices.
