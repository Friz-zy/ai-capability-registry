## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### build-mcp-app
This skill should be used when the user wants to build an "MCP app", add "interactive UI" or "widgets" to an MCP server, "render components in chat", build "MCP UI resources", make a tool that shows a "form", "picker", "dashboard" or "confirmation dialog" inline in the conversation, or mentions "apps SDK" in the context of MCP. Use AFTER the build-mcp-server skill has settled the deployment model, or when the user already knows they want UI widgets.

### build-mcp-server
This skill should be used when the user asks to "build an MCP server", "create an MCP", "make an MCP integration", "wrap an API for Claude", "expose tools to Claude", "make an MCP app", or discusses building something with the Model Context Protocol. It is the entry point for MCP server development — it interrogates the user about their use case, determines the right deployment model (remote HTTP, MCPB, local stdio), picks a tool-design pattern, and hands off to specialized skills.

### build-mcpb
This skill should be used when the user wants to "package an MCP server", "bundle an MCP", "make an MCPB", "ship a local MCP server", "distribute a local MCP", discusses ".mcpb files", mentions bundling a Node or Python runtime with their MCP server, or needs an MCP server that interacts with the local filesystem, desktop apps, or OS and must be installable without the user having Node/Python set up.

### chatgpt-apps
Build, scaffold, refactor, and troubleshoot ChatGPT Apps SDK applications that combine an MCP server and widget UI. Use when Codex needs to design tools, register UI resources, wire the MCP Apps bridge or ChatGPT compatibility APIs, apply Apps SDK metadata or CSP or domain settings, or produce a docs-aligned project scaffold. Prefer a docs-first workflow by invoking the openai-docs skill or OpenAI developer docs MCP tools before generating code.

### figma
Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting.

### figma-create-design-system-rules
Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md`

### mcp-integration
This skill should be used when the user asks to "add MCP server", "integrate MCP", "configure MCP in plugin", "use .mcp.json", "set up Model Context Protocol", "connect external service", mentions "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} with MCP", or discusses MCP server types (SSE, stdio, HTTP, WebSocket). Provides comprehensive guidance for integrating Model Context Protocol servers into Claude Code plugins for external tool and service integration.

### meeting-sdk/linux
Zoom Meeting SDK for Linux - C++ headless meeting bots with raw audio/video access, transcription, recording, and AI integration for server-side automation

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/zoom-plugin/skills/meeting-sdk/linux/SKILL.md`

### rivet-sdk
Reference skill for Zoom Rivet SDK. Use after routing to a Rivet-based server workflow when implementing auth handling, webhook consumers, API wrappers, multi-module composition, or Lambda receiver patterns.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/zoom-plugin/skills/rivet-sdk/SKILL.md`

### zoom-mcp
Guidance for the bundled Zoom MCP connectors. Use after routing to an MCP workflow when planning or troubleshooting tool-based access to meetings, recordings, meeting assets, or transcripts. Route Zoom Docs requests to the dedicated Docs MCP server and Whiteboard-specific requests to `zoom-mcp/whiteboard`.
