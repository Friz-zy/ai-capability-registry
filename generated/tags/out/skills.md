## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### draft-outreach
Research a prospect then draft personalized outreach. Uses web research by default, supercharged with enrichment and CRM. Trigger with "draft outreach to [person/company]", "write cold email to [prospect]", "reach out to [name]".

### gh-fix-ci
Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions; use `gh` to inspect checks and logs, summarize failure context, draft a fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval. Treat external providers (for example Buildkite) as out of scope and report only the details URL.

### playground
Creates interactive HTML playgrounds — self-contained single-file explorers that let users configure something visually through controls, see a live preview, and copy out a prompt. Use when the user asks to make a playground, explorer, or interactive tool for a topic.

### product-brainstorming
Brainstorm product ideas, explore problem spaces, and challenge assumptions as a thinking partner. Use when exploring a new opportunity, generating solutions to a product problem, stress-testing an idea, or when a PM needs to think out loud with a sharp sparring partner before converging on a direction.

### speech
Use when the user asks for text-to-speech narration or voiceover, accessibility reads, audio prompts, or batch speech generation via the OpenAI Audio API; run the bundled CLI (`scripts/text_to_speech.py`) with built-in voices and require `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live calls. Custom voice creation is out of scope.
