## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### accessibility-review
Run a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit on a design or page. Trigger with "audit accessibility", "check a11y", "is this accessible?", or when reviewing a design for color contrast, keyboard navigation, touch target size, or screen reader behavior before handoff.

### audit-context-building
Enables ultra-granular, line-by-line code analysis to build deep architectural context before vulnerability or bug finding.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/audit-context-building/skills/audit-context-building/SKILL.md`

### audit-prep-assistant
Prepares codebases for security review using Trail of Bits' checklist. Helps set review goals, runs static analysis tools, increases test coverage, removes dead code, ensures accessibility, and generates documentation (flowcharts, user stories, inline comments).

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/audit-prep-assistant/SKILL.md`

### audit-support
Support SOX 404 compliance with control testing methodology, sample selection, and documentation standards. Use when generating testing workpapers, selecting audit samples, classifying control deficiencies, or preparing for internal or external audits.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/finance/skills/audit-support/SKILL.md`

### burpsuite-project-parser
Searches and explores Burp Suite project files (.burp) from the command line. Use when searching response headers or bodies with regex patterns, extracting security audit findings, dumping proxy history or site map data, or analyzing HTTP traffic captured in a Burp project.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/burpsuite-project-parser/skills/burpsuite-project-parser/SKILL.md`

### claude-md-improver
Audit and improve CLAUDE.md files in repositories. Use when user asks to check, audit, update, improve, or fix CLAUDE.md files. Scans for all CLAUDE.md files, evaluates quality against templates, outputs quality report, then makes targeted updates. Also use when the user mentions "CLAUDE.md maintenance" or "project memory optimization".

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/claude-md-management/skills/claude-md-improver/SKILL.md`

### compliance-tracking
Track compliance requirements and audit readiness. Trigger with "compliance", "audit prep", "SOC 2", "ISO 27001", "GDPR", "regulatory requirement", or when the user needs help tracking, preparing for, or documenting compliance activities.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/operations/skills/compliance-tracking/SKILL.md`

### design-system
Audit, document, or extend your design system. Use when checking for naming inconsistencies or hardcoded values across components, writing documentation for a component's variants, states, and accessibility notes, or designing a new pattern that fits the existing system.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/design/skills/design-system/SKILL.md`

### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/entry-point-analyzer/skills/entry-point-analyzer/SKILL.md`

### journal-entry
Prepare journal entries with proper debits, credits, and supporting detail. Use when booking month-end accruals (AP, payroll, prepaid), recording depreciation or amortization, posting revenue recognition or deferred revenue adjustments, or documenting an entry for audit review.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/finance/skills/journal-entry/SKILL.md`

### process-doc
Document a business process — flowcharts, RACI, and SOPs. Use when formalizing a process that lives in someone's head, building a RACI to clarify who owns what, writing an SOP for a handoff or audit, or capturing the exceptions and edge cases of how work actually gets done.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/operations/skills/process-doc/SKILL.md`

### seo-audit
Run a comprehensive SEO audit — keyword research, on-page analysis, content gaps, technical checks, and competitor comparison. Use when assessing a site's SEO health, when finding keyword opportunities and content gaps competitors own, or when you need a prioritized action plan split into quick wins and strategic investments.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/marketing/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md`

### tech-debt
Identify, categorize, and prioritize technical debt. Trigger with "tech debt", "technical debt audit", "what should we refactor", "code health", or when the user asks about code quality, refactoring priorities, or maintenance backlog.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/engineering/skills/tech-debt/SKILL.md`

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/trailmark/skills/trailmark/SKILL.md`

### zeroize-audit
Detects missing zeroization of sensitive data in source code and identifies zeroization removed by compiler optimizations, with assembly-level analysis, and control-flow verification. Use for auditing C/C++/Rust code handling secrets, keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/zeroize-audit/skills/zeroize-audit/SKILL.md`
