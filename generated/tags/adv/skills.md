### cardputer-buddy
Iterate on the Cardputer-Adv MicroPython app bundle (Claude Buddy, Snake, Hello) after the device is already provisioned via m5-onboard. Use when the user wants to add a new app, push a single changed .py without re-flashing, watch device serial logs, or run a one-shot REPL command. Trigger on "add an app", "push to the cardputer", "tail the device", "run on the device", or follow-up work after /maker-setup.

### m5-onboard
End-to-end onboarding for a freshly-plugged-in M5Stack ESP32 device (Cardputer, Cardputer-Adv, Core, CoreS3, Stick) — detect on USB, flash UIFlow 2.0 firmware, and install the Claude Buddy MicroPython app bundle. Use whenever the user plugs in or wants to flash/provision/reset an M5Stack or ESP32 board, or says "m5-onboard go".
