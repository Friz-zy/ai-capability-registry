### build-mcp-app
This skill should be used when the user wants to build an "MCP app", add "interactive UI" or "widgets" to an MCP server, "render components in chat", build "MCP UI resources", make a tool that shows a "form", "picker", "dashboard" or "confirmation dialog" inline in the conversation, or mentions "apps SDK" in the context of MCP. Use AFTER the build-mcp-server skill has settled the deployment model, or when the user already knows they want UI widgets.

### build-mcp-server
This skill should be used when the user asks to "build an MCP server", "create an MCP", "make an MCP integration", "wrap an API for Claude", "expose tools to Claude", "make an MCP app", or discusses building something with the Model Context Protocol. It is the entry point for MCP server development — it interrogates the user about their use case, determines the right deployment model (remote HTTP, MCPB, local stdio), picks a tool-design pattern, and hands off to specialized skills.
