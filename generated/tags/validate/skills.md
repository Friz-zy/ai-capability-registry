### hatch-pet
Create, repair, validate, preview, and package Codex-compatible animated pets and pet spritesheets from character art, screenshots, generated images, or visual references. Use when a user wants to hatch a Codex pet, create a custom animated pet, or build a built-in pet asset with an 8x9 atlas, transparent unused cells, row-by-row animation prompts, QA contact sheets, preview videos, and pet.json packaging. This skill composes the installed $imagegen system skill for visual generation and uses bundled scripts for deterministic spritesheet assembly.

### hook-development
This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a hook", "add a PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop hook", "validate tool use", "implement prompt-based hooks", "use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}", "set up event-driven automation", "block dangerous commands", or mentions hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, PreCompact, Notification). Provides comprehensive guidance for creating and implementing Claude Code plugin hooks with focus on advanced prompt-based hooks API.
