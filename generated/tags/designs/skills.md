## Skills

### canvas-design
Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations.

### figma-code-connect-components
Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`.

### figma-implement-design
Translates Figma designs into production-ready application code with 1:1 visual fidelity. Use when implementing UI code from Figma files, when user mentions "implement design", "generate code", "implement component", provides Figma URLs, or asks to build components matching Figma specs. For Figma canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`.

### sharp-edges
Identifies error-prone APIs, dangerous configurations, and footgun designs that enable security mistakes. Use when reviewing API designs, configuration schemas, cryptographic library ergonomics, or evaluating whether code follows 'secure by default' and 'pit of success' principles. Triggers: footgun, misuse-resistant, secure defaults, API usability, dangerous configuration.
