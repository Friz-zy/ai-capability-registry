### audit-prep-assistant
Prepares codebases for security review using Trail of Bits' checklist. Helps set review goals, runs static analysis tools, increases test coverage, removes dead code, ensures accessibility, and generates documentation (flowcharts, user stories, inline comments).

### brief
Generate contextual briefings for legal work — daily summary, topic research, or incident response. Use when starting your day and need a scan of legal-relevant items across email, calendar, and contracts, when researching a specific legal question across internal sources, or when a developing situation (data breach, litigation threat, regulatory inquiry) needs rapid context.

### cairo-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Cairo/StarkNet smart contracts for 6 critical vulnerabilities including felt252 arithmetic overflow, L1-L2 messaging issues, address conversion problems, and signature replay. Use when auditing StarkNet projects.

### code-maturity-assessor
Systematic code maturity assessment using Trail of Bits' 9-category framework. Analyzes codebase for arithmetic safety, auditing practices, access controls, complexity, decentralization, documentation, MEV risks, low-level code, and testing. Produces professional scorecard with evidence-based ratings and actionable recommendations.

### cosmos-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Cosmos SDK blockchain modules and CosmWasm contracts for consensus-critical vulnerabilities — chain halts, fund loss, state divergence. 25 core + 16 IBC + 10 EVM + 3 CosmWasm patterns. Use when auditing custom x/ modules, reviewing IBC integrations, or assessing pre-launch chain security. Updated for SDK v0.53.x.

### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

### guidelines-advisor
Smart contract development advisor based on Trail of Bits' best practices. Analyzes codebase to generate documentation/specifications, review architecture, check upgradeability patterns, assess implementation quality, identify pitfalls, review dependencies, and evaluate testing. Provides actionable recommendations.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/guidelines-advisor/SKILL.md`

### property-based-testing
Provides guidance for property-based testing across multiple languages and smart contracts. Use when writing tests, reviewing code with serialization/validation/parsing patterns, designing features, or when property-based testing would provide stronger coverage than example-based tests.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/property-based-testing/skills/property-based-testing/SKILL.md`

### scv-scan
Audits Solidity codebases for smart contract vulnerabilities using a four-phase workflow (cheatsheet loading, codebase sweep, deep validation, reporting) covering 36 vulnerability classes. Use when auditing Solidity contracts for security issues, performing smart contract vulnerability scans, or reviewing Solidity code for common exploit patterns.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills-curated/plugins/scv-scan/skills/scv-scan/SKILL.md`

### secure-workflow-guide
Guides through Trail of Bits' 5-step secure development workflow. Runs Slither scans, checks special features (upgradeability/ERC conformance/token integration), generates visual security diagrams, helps document security properties for fuzzing/verification, and reviews manual security areas.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/secure-workflow-guide/SKILL.md`

### solana-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Solana programs for 6 critical vulnerabilities including arbitrary CPI, improper PDA validation, missing signer/ownership checks, and sysvar spoofing. Use when auditing Solana/Anchor programs.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/solana-vulnerability-scanner/SKILL.md`

### substrate-vulnerability-scanner
Scans Substrate/Polkadot pallets for 7 critical vulnerabilities including arithmetic overflow, panic DoS, incorrect weights, and bad origin checks. Use when auditing Substrate runtimes or FRAME pallets.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/substrate-vulnerability-scanner/SKILL.md`

### token-integration-analyzer
Token integration and implementation analyzer based on Trail of Bits' token integration checklist. Analyzes token implementations for ERC20/ERC721 conformity, checks for 20+ weird token patterns, assesses contract composition and owner privileges, performs on-chain scarcity analysis, and evaluates how protocols handle non-standard tokens. Context-aware for both token implementations and token integrations.

File: `external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/token-integration-analyzer/SKILL.md`

### ton-vulnerability-scanner
Scans TON (The Open Network) smart contracts for 3 critical vulnerabilities including integer-as-boolean misuse, fake Jetton contracts, and forward TON without gas checks. Use when auditing FunC contracts.
