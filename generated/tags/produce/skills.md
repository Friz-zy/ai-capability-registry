## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### chatgpt-apps
Build, scaffold, refactor, and troubleshoot ChatGPT Apps SDK applications that combine an MCP server and widget UI. Use when Codex needs to design tools, register UI resources, wire the MCP Apps bridge or ChatGPT compatibility APIs, apply Apps SDK metadata or CSP or domain settings, or produce a docs-aligned project scaffold. Prefer a docs-first workflow by invoking the openai-docs skill or OpenAI developer docs MCP tools before generating code.

### docx
Use this skill whenever the user wants to create, read, edit, or manipulate Word documents (.docx files). Triggers include: any mention of 'Word doc', 'word document', '.docx', or requests to produce professional documents with formatting like tables of contents, headings, page numbers, or letterheads. Also use when extracting or reorganizing content from .docx files, inserting or replacing images in documents, performing find-and-replace in Word files, working with tracked changes or comments, or converting content into a polished Word document. If the user asks for a 'report', 'memo', 'letter', 'template', or similar deliverable as a Word or .docx file, use this skill. Do NOT use for PDFs, spreadsheets, Google Docs, or general coding tasks unrelated to document generation.
