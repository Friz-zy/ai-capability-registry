## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### constant-time-analysis
Detects timing side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic code. Use when implementing or reviewing crypto code, encountering division on secrets, secret-dependent branches, or constant-time programming questions in C, C++, Go, Rust, Swift, Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, or Ruby.

### devcontainer-setup
Creates devcontainers with Claude Code, language-specific tooling (Python/Node/Rust/Go), and persistent volumes. Use when adding devcontainer support to a project, setting up isolated development environments, or configuring sandboxed Claude Code workspaces.

### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

### zeroize-audit
Detects missing zeroization of sensitive data in source code and identifies zeroization removed by compiler optimizations, with assembly-level analysis, and control-flow verification. Use for auditing C/C++/Rust code handling secrets, keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.
