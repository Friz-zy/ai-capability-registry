### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.

### vendor-review
Evaluate a vendor — cost analysis, risk assessment, and recommendation. Use when reviewing a new vendor proposal, deciding whether to renew or replace a contract, comparing two vendors side-by-side, or building a TCO breakdown and negotiation points before procurement sign-off.
