# loading

## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

### scv-scan
Audits Solidity codebases for smart contract vulnerabilities using a four-phase workflow (cheatsheet loading, codebase sweep, deep validation, reporting) covering 36 vulnerability classes. Use when auditing Solidity contracts for security issues, performing smart contract vulnerability scans, or reviewing Solidity code for common exploit patterns.
