### audit-prep-assistant
Prepares codebases for security review using Trail of Bits' checklist. Helps set review goals, runs static analysis tools, increases test coverage, removes dead code, ensures accessibility, and generates documentation (flowcharts, user stories, inline comments).

### crypto-protocol-diagram
Extracts protocol message flow from source code, RFCs, academic papers, pseudocode, informal prose, ProVerif (.pv), or Tamarin (.spthy) models and generates Mermaid sequenceDiagrams with cryptographic annotations. Use when diagramming a crypto protocol, visualizing a handshake or key exchange flow, extracting message flow from a spec or RFC, diagramming a ProVerif or Tamarin model, or drawing sequence diagrams for TLS, Noise, Signal, X3DH, Double Ratchet, FROST, DH, or ECDH protocols.

### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

### figma-create-design-system-rules
Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection.

### frontend-design
Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

### seatbelt-sandboxer
Generates minimal macOS Seatbelt sandbox configurations. Use when sandboxing, isolating, or restricting macOS applications with allowlist-based profiles.

### secure-workflow-guide
Guides through Trail of Bits' 5-step secure development workflow. Runs Slither scans, checks special features (upgradeability/ERC conformance/token integration), generates visual security diagrams, helps document security properties for fuzzing/verification, and reviews manual security areas.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/building-secure-contracts/skills/secure-workflow-guide/SKILL.md`

### vector-forge
Mutation-driven test vector generation. Finds implementations of a cryptographic algorithm or protocol, runs mutation testing to identify escaped mutants, then generates new test vectors that deliberately exercise the uncovered code paths. Compares before/after mutation kill rates to prove vector effectiveness. Use when generating cryptographic test vectors, measuring Wycheproof coverage gaps, finding escaped mutants via mutation testing, creating cross-implementation test suites, or improving test vector coverage for crypto primitives.
