## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### accessibility-review
Run a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit on a design or page. Trigger with "audit accessibility", "check a11y", "is this accessible?", or when reviewing a design for color contrast, keyboard navigation, touch target size, or screen reader behavior before handoff.

### semgrep-rule-variant-creator
Creates language variants of existing Semgrep rules. Use when porting a Semgrep rule to specified target languages. Takes an existing rule and target languages as input, produces independent rule+test directories for each language.

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.

### trailmark-structural
Runs full Trailmark structural analysis on Trailmark 0.2.x by building a graph, running `preanalysis()`, and reporting hotspots, taint, blast radius, privilege boundaries, and attack surface. Use when vivisect needs detailed structural data for a target. Triggers: structural analysis, blast radius, taint analysis, complexity hotspots.
