## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### account-research
Research a company using Common Room data. Triggers on 'research [company]', 'tell me about [domain]', 'pull up signals for [account]', 'what's going on with [company]', or any account-level question.

### code-maturity-assessor
Systematic code maturity assessment using Trail of Bits' 9-category framework. Analyzes codebase for arithmetic safety, auditing practices, access controls, complexity, decentralization, documentation, MEV risks, low-level code, and testing. Produces professional scorecard with evidence-based ratings and actionable recommendations.

### contact-research
Research a specific person using Common Room data. Triggers on 'who is [name]', 'look up [email]', 'research [contact]', 'is [name] a warm lead', or any contact-level question.

### entry-point-analyzer
Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only), and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions. Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm) or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, external functions, access control patterns, or privileged operations.

### screenshot
Use when the user explicitly asks for a desktop or system screenshot (full screen, specific app or window, or a pixel region), or when tool-specific capture capabilities are unavailable and an OS-level capture is needed.

### zeroize-audit
Detects missing zeroization of sensitive data in source code and identifies zeroization removed by compiler optimizations, with assembly-level analysis, and control-flow verification. Use for auditing C/C++/Rust code handling secrets, keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.
