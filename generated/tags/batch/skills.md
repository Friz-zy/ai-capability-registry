Load skill file when task matches.

### claude-api
Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements). TRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project. SKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.

### scvi-tools
Deep learning for single-cell analysis using scvi-tools. This skill should be used when users need (1) data integration and batch correction with scVI/scANVI, (2) ATAC-seq analysis with PeakVI, (3) CITE-seq multi-modal analysis with totalVI, (4) multiome RNA+ATAC analysis with MultiVI, (5) spatial transcriptomics deconvolution with DestVI, (6) label transfer and reference mapping with scANVI/scArches, (7) RNA velocity with veloVI, or (8) any deep learning-based single-cell method. Triggers include mentions of scVI, scANVI, totalVI, PeakVI, MultiVI, DestVI, veloVI, sysVI, scArches, variational autoencoder, VAE, batch correction, data integration, multi-modal, CITE-seq, multiome, reference mapping, latent space.

### speech
Use when the user asks for text-to-speech narration or voiceover, accessibility reads, audio prompts, or batch speech generation via the OpenAI Audio API; run the bundled CLI (`scripts/text_to_speech.py`) with built-in voices and require `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live calls. Custom voice creation is out of scope.
