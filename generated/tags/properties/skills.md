## Skills
Load skill file when task matches.

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

### mermaid-to-proverif
Translates Mermaid sequenceDiagrams describing cryptographic protocols into ProVerif formal verification models (.pv files). Use when generating a ProVerif model, formally verifying a protocol, converting a Mermaid diagram to ProVerif, verifying protocol security properties (secrecy, authentication, forward secrecy), checking for replay attacks, or producing a .pv file from a sequence diagram.

### secure-workflow-guide
Guides through Trail of Bits' 5-step secure development workflow. Runs Slither scans, checks special features (upgradeability/ERC conformance/token integration), generates visual security diagrams, helps document security properties for fuzzing/verification, and reviews manual security areas.
