# perform

## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### dimensional-analysis
Annotates codebases with dimensional analysis comments documenting units, dimensions, and decimal scaling. Use when someone asks to annotate units in a codebase, perform a dimensional analysis, or find vulnerabilities in a DeFi protocol, offchain code, or other blockchain-related codebase with arithmetic. Prevents dimensional mismatches and catches formula bugs early.

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

### openai-security-best-practices
Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements.

### security-best-practices
Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements. Trigger only when the user explicitly requests security best practices guidance, a security review/report, or secure-by-default coding help. Trigger only for supported languages (python, javascript/typescript, go). Do not trigger for general code review, debugging, or non-security tasks.

### security-threat-model
Repository-grounded threat modeling that enumerates trust boundaries, assets, attacker capabilities, abuse paths, and mitigations, and writes a concise Markdown threat model. Trigger only when the user explicitly asks to threat model a codebase or path, enumerate threats/abuse paths, or perform AppSec threat modeling. Do not trigger for general architecture summaries, code review, or non-security design work.

### sentry
Use when the user asks to inspect Sentry issues or events, summarize recent production errors, or pull basic Sentry health data via the Sentry CLI; perform read-only queries using the `sentry` command.
