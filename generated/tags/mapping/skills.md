Load skill file when task matches.

### email-sequence
Design and draft multi-email sequences with full copy, timing, branching logic, exit conditions, and performance benchmarks. Use when building onboarding, lead nurture, re-engagement, win-back, or product launch flows, when you need a complete drip campaign with A/B test suggestions, or when mapping a sequence end-to-end with a flow diagram.

### figma-code-connect-components
Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`.

### scvi-tools
Deep learning for single-cell analysis using scvi-tools. This skill should be used when users need (1) data integration and batch correction with scVI/scANVI, (2) ATAC-seq analysis with PeakVI, (3) CITE-seq multi-modal analysis with totalVI, (4) multiome RNA+ATAC analysis with MultiVI, (5) spatial transcriptomics deconvolution with DestVI, (6) label transfer and reference mapping with scANVI/scArches, (7) RNA velocity with veloVI, or (8) any deep learning-based single-cell method. Triggers include mentions of scVI, scANVI, totalVI, PeakVI, MultiVI, DestVI, veloVI, sysVI, scArches, variational autoencoder, VAE, batch correction, data integration, multi-modal, CITE-seq, multiome, reference mapping, latent space.

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.
