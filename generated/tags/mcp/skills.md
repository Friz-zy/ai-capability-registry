## Skills
Load skill and **use it** when task matches.

### build-mcp-app
This skill should be used when the user wants to build an "MCP app", add "interactive UI" or "widgets" to an MCP server, "render components in chat", build "MCP UI resources", make a tool that shows a "form", "picker", "dashboard" or "confirmation dialog" inline in the conversation, or mentions "apps SDK" in the context of MCP. Use AFTER the build-mcp-server skill has settled the deployment model, or when the user already knows they want UI widgets.

### build-mcp-server
This skill should be used when the user asks to "build an MCP server", "create an MCP", "make an MCP integration", "wrap an API for Claude", "expose tools to Claude", "make an MCP app", or discusses building something with the Model Context Protocol. It is the entry point for MCP server development — it interrogates the user about their use case, determines the right deployment model (remote HTTP, MCPB, local stdio), picks a tool-design pattern, and hands off to specialized skills.

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/mcp-server-dev/skills/build-mcp-server/SKILL.md`

### build-mcpb
This skill should be used when the user wants to "package an MCP server", "bundle an MCP", "make an MCPB", "ship a local MCP server", "distribute a local MCP", discusses ".mcpb files", mentions bundling a Node or Python runtime with their MCP server, or needs an MCP server that interacts with the local filesystem, desktop apps, or OS and must be installable without the user having Node/Python set up.

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/mcp-server-dev/skills/build-mcpb/SKILL.md`

### chatgpt-apps
Build, scaffold, refactor, and troubleshoot ChatGPT Apps SDK applications that combine an MCP server and widget UI. Use when Codex needs to design tools, register UI resources, wire the MCP Apps bridge or ChatGPT compatibility APIs, apply Apps SDK metadata or CSP or domain settings, or produce a docs-aligned project scaffold. Prefer a docs-first workflow by invoking the openai-docs skill or OpenAI developer docs MCP tools before generating code.

### choose-zoom-approach
Choose the right Zoom architecture for a use case. Use when deciding between REST API, Webhooks, WebSockets, Meeting SDK, Video SDK, Zoom Apps SDK, Zoom MCP, Phone, Contact Center, or a hybrid approach.

### claude-automation-recommender
Analyze a codebase and recommend Claude Code automations (hooks, subagents, skills, plugins, MCP servers). Use when user asks for automation recommendations, wants to optimize their Claude Code setup, mentions improving Claude Code workflows, asks how to first set up Claude Code for a project, or wants to know what Claude Code features they should use.

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/claude-code-setup/skills/claude-automation-recommender/SKILL.md`

### claude-in-chrome-troubleshooting
Diagnose and fix Claude in Chrome MCP extension connectivity issues. Use when mcp__claude-in-chrome__* tools fail, return "Browser extension is not connected", or behave erratically.

File: `../external/trailofbits-skills/plugins/claude-in-chrome-troubleshooting/skills/claude-in-chrome-troubleshooting/SKILL.md`

### debug-zoom
Debug a broken Zoom integration by isolating the failure point and routing into the right Zoom references. Use when auth, API, webhook, SDK, or MCP behavior is failing and you need a ranked hypothesis list plus verification steps.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/zoom-plugin/skills/debug-zoom/SKILL.md`

### debug-zoom-integration
Debug broken Zoom implementations quickly. Use when auth, webhooks, SDK joins, MCP transport, or real-time media workflows are failing and you need to isolate the layer before proposing a fix.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/zoom-plugin/skills/debug-zoom-integration/SKILL.md`

### design-mcp-workflow
Design a Zoom MCP workflow for Claude. Use when deciding whether Zoom MCP fits a task, when planning tool-based AI workflows, or when separating MCP responsibilities from REST API responsibilities.

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/partner-built/zoom-plugin/skills/design-mcp-workflow/SKILL.md`

### figma
Use the Figma MCP server to fetch design context, screenshots, variables, and assets from Figma, and to translate Figma nodes into production code. Trigger when a task involves Figma URLs, node IDs, design-to-code implementation, or Figma MCP setup and troubleshooting.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma/SKILL.md`

### figma-create-design-system-rules
Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md`

### mcp-builder
Guide for creating high-quality MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. Use when building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services, whether in Python (FastMCP) or Node/TypeScript (MCP SDK).

File: `../external/anthropic-skills/skills/mcp-builder/SKILL.md`

### mcp-integration
This skill should be used when the user asks to "add MCP server", "integrate MCP", "configure MCP in plugin", "use .mcp.json", "set up Model Context Protocol", "connect external service", mentions "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} with MCP", or discusses MCP server types (SSE, stdio, HTTP, WebSocket). Provides comprehensive guidance for integrating Model Context Protocol servers into Claude Code plugins for external tool and service integration.

### openai-docs
Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations, help choosing the latest model for a use case, or model upgrade and prompt-upgrade guidance; prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools, use bundled references only as helper context, and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains.
