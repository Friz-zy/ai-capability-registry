File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/engineering/skills/architecture/SKILL.md`

### build-mcp-server
This skill should be used when the user asks to "build an MCP server", "create an MCP", "make an MCP integration", "wrap an API for Claude", "expose tools to Claude", "make an MCP app", or discusses building something with the Model Context Protocol. It is the entry point for MCP server development — it interrogates the user about their use case, determines the right deployment model (remote HTTP, MCPB, local stdio), picks a tool-design pattern, and hands off to specialized skills.

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/mcp-server-dev/skills/build-mcp-server/SKILL.md`

### canvas-design
Create beautiful visual art in .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. You should use this skill when the user asks to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static piece. Create original visual designs, never copying existing artists' work to avoid copyright violations.

File: `../external/anthropic-skills/skills/canvas-design/SKILL.md`

### change-request

File: `../external/anthropic-knowledge-work-plugins/engineering/skills/documentation/SKILL.md`

### docx
Use this skill whenever the user wants to create, read, edit, or manipulate Word documents (.docx files). Triggers include: any mention of 'Word doc', 'word document', '.docx', or requests to produce professional documents with formatting like tables of contents, headings, page numbers, or letterheads. Also use when extracting or reorganizing content from .docx files, inserting or replacing images in documents, performing find-and-replace in Word files, working with tracked changes or comments, or converting content into a polished Word document. If the user asks for a 'report', 'memo', 'letter', 'template', or similar deliverable as a Word or .docx file, use this skill. Do NOT use for PDFs, spreadsheets, Google Docs, or general coding tasks unrelated to document generation.

File: `../external/anthropic-skills/skills/docx/SKILL.md`

### example-skill
This skill should be used when the user asks to "demonstrate skills", "show skill format", "create a skill template", or discusses skill development patterns. Provides a reference template for creating Claude Code plugin skills.

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/example-plugin/skills/example-skill/SKILL.md`

### figma-code-connect-components
Connects Figma design components to code components using Code Connect mapping tools. Use when user says "code connect", "connect this component to code", "map this component", "link component to code", "create code connect mapping", or wants to establish mappings between Figma designs and code implementations. For canvas writes via `use_figma`, use `figma-use`.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-code-connect-components/SKILL.md`

### figma-create-design-system-rules
Generates custom design system rules for the user's codebase. Use when user says "create design system rules", "generate rules for my project", "set up design rules", "customize design system guidelines", or wants to establish project-specific conventions for Figma-to-code workflows. Requires Figma MCP server connection.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-create-design-system-rules/SKILL.md`

### figma-create-new-file
Create a new blank Figma file. Use when the user wants to create a new Figma design or FigJam file, or when you need a new file before calling use_figma. Handles plan resolution via whoami if needed. Usage — /figma-create-new-file [editorType] [fileName] (e.g. /figma-create-new-file figjam My Whiteboard)

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-create-new-file/SKILL.md`

### figma-generate-design
Use this skill alongside figma-use when the task involves translating an application page, view, or multi-section layout into Figma. Triggers: 'write to Figma', 'create in Figma from code', 'push page to Figma', 'take this app/page and build it in Figma', 'create a screen', 'build a landing page in Figma', 'update the Figma screen to match code'. This is the preferred workflow skill whenever the user wants to build or update a full page, screen, or view in Figma from code or a description. Discovers design system components, variables, and styles via search_design_system, imports them, and assembles screens incrementally section-by-section using design system tokens instead of hardcoded values.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-generate-design/SKILL.md`

### figma-generate-library
Build or update a professional-grade design system in Figma from a codebase. Use when the user wants to create variables/tokens, build component libraries, set up theming (light/dark modes), document foundations, or reconcile gaps between code and Figma. This skill teaches WHAT to build and in WHAT ORDER — it complements the `figma-use` skill which teaches HOW to call the Plugin API. Both skills should be loaded together.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-generate-library/SKILL.md`

### figma-use
**MANDATORY prerequisite** — you MUST invoke this skill BEFORE every `use_figma` tool call. NEVER call `use_figma` directly without loading this skill first. Skipping it causes common, hard-to-debug failures. Trigger whenever the user wants to perform a write action or a unique read action that requires JavaScript execution in the Figma file context — e.g. create/edit/delete nodes, set up variables or tokens, build components and variants, modify auto-layout or fills, bind variables to properties, or inspect file structure programmatically.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/figma-use/SKILL.md`

### frontend-design
Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (examples include websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts, or when styling/beautifying any web UI). Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

### imagegen
Generate or edit raster images when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, or derive visual variants from references, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas.

File: `../external/openai-skills/skills/.system/imagegen/SKILL.md`

### interview-prep

File: `../external/anthropic-claude-plugins-official/plugins/hookify/skills/writing-rules/SKILL.md`

### xlsx
Use this skill any time a spreadsheet file is the primary input or output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas, formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch or from other data sources; or convert between tabular file formats. Trigger especially when the user references a spreadsheet file by name or path — even casually (like \"the xlsx in my downloads\") — and wants something done to it or produced from it. Also trigger for cleaning or restructuring messy tabular data files (malformed rows, misplaced headers, junk data) into proper spreadsheets. The deliverable must be a spreadsheet file. Do NOT trigger when the primary deliverable is a Word document, HTML report, standalone Python script, database pipeline, or Google Sheets API integration, even if tabular data is involved.
