### angular-http
Implement HTTP data fetching in Angular v20+ using resource(), httpResource(), and HttpClient. Use for API calls, data loading with signals, request/response handling, and interceptors. Triggers on data fetching, API integration, loading states, error handling, or converting Observable-based HTTP to signal-based patterns.

### claude-api
Build, debug, and optimize Claude API / Anthropic SDK apps. Apps built with this skill should include prompt caching. Also handles migrating existing Claude API code between Claude model versions (4.5 → 4.6, 4.6 → 4.7, retired-model replacements). TRIGGER when: code imports `anthropic`/`@anthropic-ai/sdk`; user asks for the Claude API, Anthropic SDK, or Managed Agents; user adds/modifies/tunes a Claude feature (caching, thinking, compaction, tool use, batch, files, citations, memory) or model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) in a file; questions about prompt caching / cache hit rate in an Anthropic SDK project. SKIP: file imports `openai`/other-provider SDK, filename like `*-openai.py`/`*-generic.py`, provider-neutral code, general programming/ML.

### cli-creator
Build a composable CLI for Codex from API docs, an OpenAPI spec, existing curl examples, an SDK, a web app, an admin tool, or a local script. Use when the user wants Codex to create a command-line tool that can run from any repo, expose composable read/write commands, return stable JSON, manage auth, and pair with a companion skill.

### openai-docs
Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations, help choosing the latest model for a use case, or model upgrade and prompt-upgrade guidance; prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools, use bundled references only as helper context, and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains.

### sharp-edges
Identifies error-prone APIs, dangerous configurations, and footgun designs that enable security mistakes. Use when reviewing API designs, configuration schemas, cryptographic library ergonomics, or evaluating whether code follows 'secure by default' and 'pit of success' principles. Triggers: footgun, misuse-resistant, secure defaults, API usability, dangerous configuration.
