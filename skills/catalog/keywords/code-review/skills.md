## Skills
Select only the most relevant skills by description, then read only those `SKILL.md` files.

### code-review
Review code changes for security, performance, and correctness. Trigger with a PR URL or diff, "review this before I merge", "is this code safe?", or when checking a change for N+1 queries, injection risks, missing edge cases, or error handling gaps.

### openai-security-best-practices
Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements.

### second-opinion
Runs external LLM code reviews (OpenAI Codex or Google Gemini CLI) on uncommitted changes, branch diffs, or specific commits. Use when the user asks for a second opinion, external review, codex review, gemini review, or mentions /second-opinion.

### security-best-practices
Perform language and framework specific security best-practice reviews and suggest improvements. Trigger only when the user explicitly requests security best practices guidance, a security review/report, or secure-by-default coding help. Trigger only for supported languages (python, javascript/typescript, go). Do not trigger for general code review, debugging, or non-security tasks.

File: `external/openai-skills/skills/.curated/security-best-practices/SKILL.md`

### security-ownership-map
Analyze git repositories to build a security ownership topology (people-to-file), compute bus factor and sensitive-code ownership, and export CSV/JSON for graph databases and visualization. Trigger only when the user explicitly wants a security-oriented ownership or bus-factor analysis grounded in git history (for example: orphaned sensitive code, security maintainers, CODEOWNERS reality checks for risk, sensitive hotspots, or ownership clusters). Do not trigger for general maintainer lists or non-security ownership questions.
