Select only the most relevant skills by description. If a skill matches, read its `SKILL.md` before applying it.

### graph-evolution
Compares Trailmark code graphs at two source code snapshots (git commits, tags, or directories) to surface security-relevant structural changes. Detects new attack paths, complexity shifts, blast radius growth, taint propagation changes, and privilege boundary modifications that text diffs miss. Use when comparing code between commits or tags, analyzing structural evolution, detecting attack surface growth, reviewing what changed between audit snapshots, or finding security-relevant changes that text diffs miss.

### trailmark
Builds and queries multi-language source code graphs for security analysis. Includes pre-analysis passes for blast radius, taint propagation, privilege boundaries, and entry point enumeration. Use when analyzing call paths, mapping attack surface, finding complexity hotspots, enumerating entry points, tracing taint propagation, measuring blast radius, or building a code graph for audit prioritization. Prefer `trailmark.parse.detect_languages()` or `--language auto` when the target language is unknown or polyglot.

### trailmark-structural
Runs full Trailmark structural analysis on Trailmark 0.2.x by building a graph, running `preanalysis()`, and reporting hotspots, taint, blast radius, privilege boundaries, and attack surface. Use when vivisect needs detailed structural data for a target. Triggers: structural analysis, blast radius, taint analysis, complexity hotspots.
