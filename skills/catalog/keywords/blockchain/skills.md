### dimensional-analysis
Annotates codebases with dimensional analysis comments documenting units, dimensions, and decimal scaling. Use when someone asks to annotate units in a codebase, perform a dimensional analysis, or find vulnerabilities in a DeFi protocol, offchain code, or other blockchain-related codebase with arithmetic. Prevents dimensional mismatches and catches formula bugs early.

### token-integration-analyzer
Token integration and implementation analyzer based on Trail of Bits' token integration checklist. Analyzes token implementations for ERC20/ERC721 conformity, checks for 20+ weird token patterns, assesses contract composition and owner privileges, performs on-chain scarcity analysis, and evaluates how protocols handle non-standard tokens. Context-aware for both token implementations and token integrations.
