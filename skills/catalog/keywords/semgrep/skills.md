### semgrep
Run Semgrep static analysis scan on a codebase using parallel subagents. Supports two scan modes — "run all" (full ruleset coverage) and "important only" (high-confidence security vulnerabilities). Automatically detects and uses Semgrep Pro for cross-file taint analysis when available. Use when asked to scan code for vulnerabilities, run a security audit with Semgrep, find bugs, or perform static analysis. Spawns parallel workers for multi-language codebases.

### semgrep-rule-creator
Creates custom Semgrep rules for detecting security vulnerabilities, bug patterns, and code patterns. Use when writing Semgrep rules or building custom static analysis detections.

### semgrep-rule-variant-creator
Creates language variants of existing Semgrep rules. Use when porting a Semgrep rule to specified target languages. Takes an existing rule and target languages as input, produces independent rule+test directories for each language.
